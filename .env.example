# --- Processing Settings (Optional Overrides) ---
# Choose model size: 'tiny.en', 'base.en', 'small.en', 'medium.en', 'large-v2', 'large-v3'
# Larger models are more accurate but require MUCH more VRAM/RAM and are slower. Start small.
# FASTER_WHISPER_MODEL=base.en
# Compute type: 'int8' (fastest, lower RAM, good accuracy), 'float16' (GPU recommended), 'float32' (CPU/GPU precise, slower)
# FASTER_WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE=int8
# Pyannote pipeline: 'pyannote/speaker-diarization@2.1' is common, check for newer versions.
# PYANNOTE_PIPELINE=pyannote/speaker-diarization@2.1

# --- FFmpeg Path (Optional Override) ---
# If ffmpeg/ffprobe are not in your system PATH, provide the full path to the executable.
# Example Windows: FFMPEG_PATH=C:/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe
# Example Linux: FFMPEG_PATH=/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
# FFMPEG_PATH=ffmpeg
